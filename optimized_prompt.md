# ðŸ§  AUDIE: META-AGENT AI SCHEDULER

## SYSTEM CORE
- **Type**: Hybrid System with Embedded Agents
- **Purpose**: Command simplicity, emotional clarity, multi-modal control
- **Interface**: Single conversational agent (Audie) managing all sub-systems

## VISION
A unified system where one agent (Audie) handles all communication, delegates tasks, manages scheduling, and provides real-time updates through:

- ðŸ“Š **Dashboard Interface**:
  - Task Schedule
  - Human Tasks Queue
  - Inbox/Intake Feed
  - Estimate/Invoice Tracker

- ðŸ”„ **Core Workflows**:
  - Client intake â†’ Scheduling â†’ Execution â†’ Invoicing
  - Email/message parsing â†’ Task creation
  - Estimate creation â†’ Approval â†’ Job scheduling â†’ Invoice generation

- ðŸ”Œ **Integrations**: Gmail, Google Calendar, Trello

## ARCHITECTURE

### 1. Agent Layer
- **Audie (Meta-Agent)**: Central interface, command router
- **Sub-Agents**:
  - Scheduler (Calendar management)
  - Human Task Agent (Decision requests)
  - Inbox Parser (Email/WhatsApp â†’ structured tasks)
  - Logger (Memory + reflection)
  - Invoice Agent (Estimate/invoice lifecycle)

### 2. Data Layer
- SQLite for persistent storage
- Client/Job/Invoice schema
- Task tracking system

### 3. Integration Layer
- Gmail API connector
- Google Calendar API
- Trello API (future)

## WORKFLOWS

### Estimate â†’ Invoice Lifecycle
1. Create estimate from client request
2. Send branded estimate to client
3. Track approval status
4. Convert to scheduled job when approved
5. Generate invoice after completion
6. Track payment status

### Daily Operations
1. Morning brief (upcoming tasks)
2. Ongoing task updates and chat interaction
3. Evening reflection and completion report
