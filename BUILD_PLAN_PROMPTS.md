# AUDIE META-AGENT BUILD PLAN PROMPTS

This document contains actionable prompts for implementing each phase of the Audie Meta-Agent build plan, with each prompt designed to be used with an AI assistant.

## 1. API Integration Testing

```prompt
Implement comprehensive API integration testing for the Audie Meta-Agent system, focusing on the Google Calendar and Gmail APIs. The system already has fallback mechanisms to mock data, but we need to verify these work correctly and ensure proper error handling.

Tasks:
1. Create test cases for the SchedulerAgent that verify:
   - Successful API connection when credentials are valid
   - Proper fallback to mock data when credentials are missing
   - Error handling when API requests fail (network errors, rate limiting)
   - Data format consistency between real API and mock data

2. Create test cases for the InboxAgent that verify:
   - Email fetching with valid Gmail credentials
   - Fallback to mock emails when credentials are missing
   - Error handling for various Gmail API failures
   - Task extraction logic from both real and mock emails

3. Implement a test utility that can:
   - Simulate API failures to trigger fallback mechanisms
   - Validate response formats match between real and mock data
   - Check all error paths are properly handled without system crashes

4. Update the logging system to:
   - Clearly differentiate between real API calls and mock data usage
   - Log detailed error information for debugging
   - Track API call patterns and performance metrics

Focus on making the system resilient to all types of API failures while maintaining a consistent user experience regardless of whether real or mock data is being used.
```

## 2. Authentication Layer

```prompt
Implement a secure, JWT-based authentication system for the Audie Meta-Agent that protects API endpoints while maintaining the existing API structure and error handling patterns.

Tasks:
1. Create authentication models and database schema:
   - User model with secure password storage (bcrypt)
   - Role-based permission system (admin, user)
   - JWT token management with refresh capabilities
   - Rate limiting protection against brute force attacks

2. Implement authentication endpoints:
   - POST /api/auth/register - New user registration
   - POST /api/auth/login - User login with JWT generation
   - POST /api/auth/refresh - Token refresh endpoint
   - GET /api/auth/me - Current user information
   - POST /api/auth/logout - Token invalidation

3. Create middleware for route protection:
   - JWT verification middleware
   - Role-based access control
   - Error handling that maintains API response format
   - Request validation to prevent injection attacks

4. Secure existing endpoints:
   - Add auth middleware to all sensitive routes
   - Implement user-specific data filtering
   - Maintain API response format for authentication errors
   - Add ownership checks for data manipulation endpoints

5. Update front-end:
   - Create login/registration forms
   - Implement token storage and refresh logic
   - Add authentication state management
   - Update API calls to include authentication headers

Ensure all authentication follows best practices with proper token lifecycle management. Maintain consistent error handling and response formats as established in the current API structure.
```

5. Add natural language generation capabilities:
   - Create more natural, varied responses
   - Generate summaries of tasks, emails, and schedules
