# AUDIE META-AGENT BUILD PLAN PROMPTS

This document contains actionable prompts for implementing each phase of the Audie Meta-Agent build plan, with each prompt designed to be used with an AI assistant.

## 1. API Integration Testing

```prompt
Implement comprehensive API integration testing for the Audie Meta-Agent system, focusing on the Google Calendar and Gmail APIs. The system already has fallback mechanisms to mock data, but we need to verify these work correctly and ensure proper error handling.

## 2. Authentication Layer

```prompt
Implement a secure, JWT-based authentication system for the Audie Meta-Agent that protects API endpoints while maintaining the existing API structure and error handling patterns.

Tasks:
1. Create authentication models and database schema:
   - User model with secure password storage (bcrypt)
   - Role-based permission system (admin, user)
   - JWT token management with refresh capabilities
   - Rate limiting protection against brute force attacks

2. Implement authentication endpoints:
   - POST /api/auth/register - New user registration
   - POST /api/auth/login - User login with JWT generation
   - POST /api/auth/refresh - Token refresh endpoint
   - GET /api/auth/me - Current user information
   - POST /api/auth/logout - Token invalidation

3. Create middleware for route protection:
   - JWT verification middleware
   - Role-based access control
   - Error handling that maintains API response format
   - Request validation to prevent injection attacks

4. Secure existing endpoints:
   - Add auth middleware to all sensitive routes
   - Implement user-specific data filtering
   - Maintain API response format for authentication errors
   - Add ownership checks for data manipulation endpoints

5. Update front-end:
   - Create login/registration forms
   - Implement token storage and refresh logic
   - Add authentication state management
   - Update API calls to include authentication headers

Ensure all authentication follows best practices with proper token lifecycle management. Maintain consistent error handling and response formats as established in the current API structure.
